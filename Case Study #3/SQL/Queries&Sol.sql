-- Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

-- C. Challenge Payment Question
-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes 
-- amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

-- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
-- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
-- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
-- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments
